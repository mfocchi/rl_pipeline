This repository is a reduced version of [Locosim](https://github.com/mfocchi/locosim) ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02107)) and it is intended for reproducing simulations and experiments
presented in the manuscript 



In this work we consider the complex problem of making a monopod perform an omni-directional jump on uneven terrain. We guide the learning process within an RL framework by injecting physical knowledge. This expedient brings to widespread benefits, such as a drastic reduction of the learning
time, and the ability to learn and compensate for possible errors in the low-level controller executing the motion.

## Install Locosim

Locosim is composed by a **roscontrol** node called **ros_impedance_controller** (written in C++) that interfaces the 
Python ros node (where the controller is written) to a Gazebo simulator.

### SOFTWARE VERSIONS:

Locosim is compatible with Ubuntu 16/18/20. The installation instructions have been generalized accordingly. 
You need replace few strings with the appropriate values according to your operating systems as follows:

| Ubuntu 18:                   | **Ubuntu 20**:               |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| PYTHON_VERSION = 3.5         | PYTHON_VERSION = 3.8         |
| ROBOTPKG_PYTHON_VERSION=py35 | ROBOTPKG_PYTHON_VERSION=py38 |
| PIP_PREFIX = pip3            | PIP_PREFIX = pip3            |
| ROS_VERSION = bionic         | ROS_VERSION = noetic         |



### Install ROS 

setup your source list:

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

Set up your keys:

```
curl -sSL 'http://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xC1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654' | sudo apt-key add -
```

install ROS main distro:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-desktop-full
```

install ROS packages:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-urdfdom-py
```

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-srdfdom
```

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-joint-state-publisher
```

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-joint-state-publisher-gui
```

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-joint-state-controller 
```

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-gazebo-msgs
```

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-control-toolbox
```

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-gazebo-ros
```

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-controller-manager
```

```
sudo apt install ros-ROS_VERSION-joint-trajectory-controller
```



#### Pinocchio stuff

**Add robotpkg as source repository to apt:**

```
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/pub $(lsb_release -sc) robotpkg' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/robotpkg.list"
```

```
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb [arch=amd64] http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/wip/packages/debian/pub $(lsb_release -sc) robotpkg' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/robotpkg.list"
```

**Register the authentication certificate of robotpkg:**

```
sudo apt install -qqy lsb-release gnupg2 curl
```

```
curl http://robotpkg.openrobots.org/packages/debian/robotpkg.key | sudo apt-key add -
```

You need to run at least once apt update to fetch the package descriptions:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

Now you can install Pinocchio and the required libraries:

```
sudo apt install robotpkg-PINOCCHIO_PYTHON_VERSION-eigenpy	
```

```
sudo apt install robotpkg-PINOCCHIO_PYTHON_VERSION-pinocchio
```

```
sudo apt-get install robotpkg-PINOCCHIO_PYTHON_VERSION-quadprog  
```

**NOTE:** If you have issues in installing robotpkg libraries you can try to install them through ROS as:

```
sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_VERSION-LIBNAME
```



###  Python

```
sudo apt-get install python3-scipy
```

```
sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
```

```
sudo apt-get install python3-termcolor
```

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```

```
sudo pip install numpy==1.17.4
```

```
sudo pip install joblib==1.2.0
```

```
sudo pip install torch==2.0.0
```

```
sudo pip install torchvision==0.15.1
```

```
sudo pip install tensorboard==2.11.0
```

```
sudo pip install torch==2.0.0
```



### Download code and setup ROS workspace

Now that you installed all the dependencies you are ready to get the code, but first you need to create a ros workspace to out the code in:

```
mkdir -p ~/ros_ws/src
```

```
cd ~/ros_ws/src
```

Now you need to call the following line manually (next you will see that it will be done automatically in the .bashrc)

```
source /opt/ros/ROS_VERSION/setup.bash
```

```
cd ~/ros_ws/
```

```
 catkin_make
```

```
 cd ~/ros_ws/src/ 
```

Now you can clone the repository inside the ROS workspace you just created:

```
git clone https://github.com/mfocchi/jump_rl.git
```

now recompile again (then this step won't bee needed anymore if you just work in Python unless you do not modify / create additional ROS packages)

```
cd ~/ros_ws/ 
```

```
 catkin_make install
```

the install step install the ros packages inside the "$HOME/ros_ws/install" folder rather than the devel folder. This folder will be added to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH instead of the devel one.

Finally, run (you should do it any time you add a new ros package)

```
 rospack profile
```

There are some additional utilities that I strongly suggest to install. You can find the list  [here](https://github.com/mfocchi/locosim/blob/develop/utils.md).



### Configure environment variables 

```
gedit  ~/.bashrc
```

copy the following lines (at the end of the .bashrc), remember to replace the string PYTHON_VERSION with the appropriate version name as explained in [software versions](#software-versions) section:

```
source /opt/ros/ROS_VERSION/setup.bash
source $HOME/ros_ws/install/setup.bash
export PATH=/opt/openrobots/bin:$PATH
export LOCOSIM_DIR=$HOME/ros_ws/src/jump_rl
export PYTHONPATH=/opt/openrobots/lib/pythonPYTHON_VERSION/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=$LOCOSIM_DIR/robot_control:$PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=$LOCOSIM_DIR/landing_controller:$PYTHONPATH
export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:/opt/openrobots/share/
```

The .bashrc is a file that is **automatically** sourced whenever you open a new terminal.



#### Compile/Install the code

Whenever you modify some of the ROS packages (e.g. the ones that contain the xacro fles inside the robot_description folder), you need to install them to be sure they are been updated in the ROS install folder. 

```
cd ~/ros_ws/ 
```

```
 catkin_make install 
```

**IMPORTANT!**

The first time you compile the code the install folder is not existing, therefore won't be added to the PYTHONPATH with the command **source $HOME/ros_ws/install/setup.bash**, and you won't be able to import the package ros_impedance_controller. Therefore, **only once**, after the first time that you compile, run again :

```
source .bashrc
```



### **Running the software** from Python IDE: Pycharm  

We recommend to use an IDE to run and edit the Python files, like Pycharm community. To install it,  you just need to download and unzip the program:

https://download.jetbrains.com/Python/pycharm-community-2021.1.1.tar.gz

 and unzip it  *inside* the home directory. 

We ask you to download this specific version (2021.1.1) that we am sure it works: newer versions seem to be failing to load environment variables. 

To be able to keep the plots **alive** at the end of the program and to have access to variables,  you need to "Edit Configurations..." and tick "Run with Python Console". Otherwise the plot will immediately close. 



### Running the Software from terminal

To run from a terminal we  use the interactive option that allows  when you close the program have access to variables:

```
$ Python3 -i $LOCOSIM_DIR/robot_control/base_controllers/climbingrobot_controller.py
```

to exit from Python3 console type CTRL+Z



### Tips and Tricks 

1) Some machines, do not have support for GPU. This means that if you run Gazebo Graphical User Interface (GUI) it can become very **slow**. A way to mitigate this is to avoid to start the  Gazebo GUI and only start the gzserver process that will compute the dynamics, you will keep the visualization in Rviz. This is referred to planners that employ BaseController or BaseControllerFixed classes. In the Python code where you start the simulator you need to pass this additional argument as follows:

```
additional_args = 'gui:=false'
p.startSimulator(..., additional_args =additional_args)
```

2) Another annoying point is the default timeout to kill Gazebo that is by default very long. You can change it (e.g. to 0.1s) by setting the  _TIMEOUT_SIGINT = 0.1 and _TIMEOUT_SIGTERM = 0.1:

```
sudo gedit /opt/ros/ROS_VERSION/lib/PYTHON_PREFIX/dist-packages/roslaunch/nodeprocess.py
```

 this will cause ROS to send a `kill` signal much sooner.

3) if you get this annoying warning: 

```
Warning: TF_REPEATED_DATA ignoring data with redundant timestamp for frame...
```

a dirty hack to fix it is to clone this repository in your workspace:

```
git clone --branch throttle-tf-repeated-data-error git@github.com:BadgerTechnologies/geometry2.git
```
